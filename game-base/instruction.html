    <h1>Instructions:</h1>
    <h2>Locate the difference between the image to the left or right. 
        Once you do, click on the discrepency on the left-image in order to proceed to the next level. 
        If you misclick, you lose a life and points to your score. Once you have no lives left, you will get a game-over screen, meaning you'll have to start again.

        The faster you find the difference, the higher your score!</h2>
