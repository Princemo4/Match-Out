        Welcome to MatchOut! The rules are simple, you will be given a set of images and one will be not quite right...
        That image will be upside down, and you have 30 seconds to click on the correct image or else you lose. The quicker
        you find it, the higher your score! You also have 3 lives... you lose one every time you misclick. Once you get to zero lives,
        you also lose. Good luck and happy searching!
    </h2>
